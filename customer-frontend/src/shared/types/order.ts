/**
 * Canonical QuickPress order contract.
 *
 * This is the ONE order model every application (customer, partner, rider,
 * admin) agrees on. Each app has its own view type tuned to its screens; those
 * are derived from this model by the mappers in `@backend/mock/mappers`, never
 * duplicated.
 *
 * When the real FastAPI backend lands, these are the response bodies the API
 * must return — nothing in the UI changes.
