 * Sprint 3.3 — UI-only mock data for the Partner Order Management module.

 * Nothing here touches a backend. Every export below is a future API
 * integration point (see PARTNER_SPRINT_3_3_ORDER_MANAGEMENT_REPORT.md).
 *
 * NOTE: no `Date.now()` / `new Date()` at module scope — SSR and the client
 * must render identical markup, so relative times are stored as plain labels
 * plus a numeric `placedMinutesAgo` used for sorting.
